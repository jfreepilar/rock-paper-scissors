# rock-paper-scissors

This is my first JavaScipt program built from scratch. The objective of this interactice project is to build a program that mirrors the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Skills on display:
1. Basic Git Workflow: Demonstrating proficiency in managing code using Git. I've established a repository on GitHub, cloned it to my local machine, made modifications to the project via local files, and effectively committed and pushed changes using Git commands in my terminal.

2. Problem-solving approach - Utilizing a systematic problem-solving approach, I've divided the task into manageable sub-problems.This strategic breakdown facilitates a more straightforward approach highlighting the critical soft skills essential for any programmer.

3. Writing Pseudocode - Ability to write readable and concise Pseudocode at the initial stage of the problem-solving process. This simplifies the code construct and anticipates potential challenges that may arise during the program's development.

4. Syntax - Using correct syntax rules to construct a JavaScript codes. Proper use of integers, strings, and other language elements crucial to the effective implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

This project is the first test of the fundamentals of JavaScript. Integrating JavaScipt codes to the HTML and CSS files can be overwhelming and frustrating. But with the right approach to problem-solving, we can solve any problem.
